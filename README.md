# DSPy Build & Optimize Agentic Apps — DeepLearning.AI 

## Overview
This repository contains projects completed during the "DSPy: Build and Optimize Agentic Apps" course by DeepLearning.AI. The course focuses on building modular, agentic AI applications using the DSPy framework and optimizing their performance through experimentation and tooling such as MLflow tracing and DSPy Optimizer.

## Projects
- **Airline Agent**  
  An intelligent agent for flight booking and airline service workflows. This agent includes full MLflow tracing integration for debugging and performance analysis.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent**  
  A RAG-based question-answering agent which achieved a **74% increase in accuracy** through optimization with DSPy’s automated tuning tools.

## Features
- Modular agent design using DSPy’s programming abstractions
- Integration of MLflow for tracing to visualize agent behavior and submodule execution
- Automated accuracy improvement through DSPy Optimizer without manual prompt engineering
- Comprehensive benchmarking and experiment tracking
